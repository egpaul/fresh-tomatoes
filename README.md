<h2>Getting Started</h2>

Fresh Tomatoes is a movie information website that is part of Udacity's IPND program or FSWD program. It is a listing of my favorite mob movies along with the movie art, description, and trailer. 

This repository contains three different files:
  - entertainment_center.py
  - fresh_tomatoes.pu
  - media.py 
You will need to pull all three files and save into the same folder

<h2>Prerequisites:</h2>

- Python 2.7.xx installed
- Python editor i.e. Atom, Idle, etc..

end

<h2>Running Program</h2>

You will need to pull all three programs and save to the same folder. The folder can be anyname of your choosing.
